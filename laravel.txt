First Of all welcome to my repository.

Now, as you all know that setting up laravel for the first time is very hard for the new user without any ones guidence.

So, let us start.

First of all we have to make php command working in command prompt.
So, that
 1. Go to Edit the System Environment Variables.
 2. In Advanced Tab, search for Environment Variables and click on it.
 3. Now in System variables, search for Path, and then double click on it or click on Edit button below.
 4. Now, Add your php installation folder location there.
        Here, I am using xampp. So in xampp there is a folder of php. That is PHP installtion folder.
        For me, that is "C:\xampp\php\"
        
        So. Add it there.
 5. Now save it and click on apply button.
 6. Now open command prompt from start menu and write "php -v" there and click enter.
       If you get something like below then you had edited environment variables successfully and ready to go on next step.

 7. Now, go in your web browser and enter this address in address bar : https://getcomposer.org/download/
 
 8. Now, there is a topic called Command Line Installation.
       Simply copy commands one by one from there and paste in command prompt and press enter.
       If all of these gets completed successfully then you can use laravel.
       
 9. Now, go in your htdocs directory of your xampp or wamp or other local server you are using.
         
         
         Now open command prompt here.
         Now, copy the below command and paste in cmd and press enter.
         
         "composer global require laravel/installer"

         now to create a new project you only requires below steps to create new project every time.
         
         just write the command below and press enter. here blog is the name of your application. You can change it according to you,
         
         "laravel new blog"
         
        *****        OR      *****
        If the above method not works then follow below method.

        just use command   "laravel new blog"   where put the name you want on the place of blog
